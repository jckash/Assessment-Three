<h1> Jennifer Clancy Kash: 
    Ex-Creative, Future Nerd</h1>

<br>
<br>

<h2 class="interests">Interests</h2>
<p> Jennifer's past was filled with creative and passion driven endeavors.
    She is obsessed with music. The writing process, production, and performance of music. 
    This is what led her in to event planning, booking, promotion, and marketing. Although
    she loved what she did, Covid-19 threw a wrench in some of her plans. She decided to 
    learn some skills that would create a bit more stability in her life. She began 
    exploring different coding websites and discovered that she found a new interest and 
    passion. She is excited to continue with following passion, creativity, and innovation.
    She also loves dancing, food, travel, hiking, weight-lifting, thrifting, editing video,
    and cocktails with muddled fresh ingredients.
